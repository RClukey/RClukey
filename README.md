## Hi there! My name is Robert Clukey

I recently graduated from Texas A&M University, Summa Cum Laude with a 4.0 GPA, studying Robotics Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering.
I am looking for full-time or internship positions where I can use my knowledge in robotic software, robotic hardware, and structural design to further advance the robotic industry.

My resume is included in the RClukey repository, or can be accessed [here](https://github.com/RClukey/RClukey/blob/main/Clukey%2CRobert-Resume.pdf).

My personal website is [here](https://rclukey.github.io/) hosted by Github, and my email address is robertclukey1234@gmail.com.
